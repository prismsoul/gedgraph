/**
 * This is a graph generator that generates dynamic random graphs.
 * 
 * <u>The principle:</u>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A graph consists in a set of vertices and a set of edges. The dynamic relies
 * on 4 kinds of steps of events: at each step:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a subset of nodes is removed</li>
 * <li>a subset of nodes is added</li>
 * <li>a subset of edges is removed (in the current version, edges that are
 * removed are those that were attached to nodes that disappear)</li>
 * <li>a subset of edges is added</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator is characterized by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>number of vertices</li>
 * <li>maximum mean degree</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>The constraints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>graph nervosity</li>
 * <li>creation links rules</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>The metrics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>mean number of vertices and edges</li>
 * <li>mean age of vertices and edges</li>
 * <li>mean distribution of degree</li>
 * <li>mean number of connected components</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * <li>...</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * How to build such graphs ? There exist at least one mathematical function for
 * doing that f(step) = nbVertices*log(step)/log(step+"Pente") the larger
 * "Pente", the softer the "pente" of the curve. Given f(step), it is possible
 * to compute nbCreations and nbDeletions together with the graph nervosity.
 * f(step) represents the number of vertices that should be present within the
 * graph given the step and the value of the parameter "Pente". However, as our
 * graph is dynamic, some vertices may be deleted while some other vertices may
 * be added to the graph.
 * 
 * Question: could it be possible to build a dynamic graph that reaches a stable
 * state (stabilization of the number of vertices, and stabilization of some
 * other properties), just by adding some constraints/characteristics on each
 * node?

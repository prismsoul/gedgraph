/**
 * Dorogovtsev - Mendes graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator creates graph using the Dorogovtsev - Mendes algorithm. This
 * starts by creating three nodes and tree edges, making a triangle, and then
 * add one node at a time. Each time a node is added, an edge is chosen randomly
 * and the node is connected via two new edges to the two extremities of the
 * chosen edge.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This process generates a power-low degree distribution, as nodes that have
 * more edges have more chances to be selected since their edges are more
 * represented in the edge set.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Dorogovtsev - Mendes algorithm always produce planar graphs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The more this generator is iterated, the more nodes are generated. It can
 * therefore generate trees of any size. A each call to {@link #nextEvents()},
 * a new node and two edges are added.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Complexity</h2>
 * 
 * At each step only one node and two edges are added.
 * 
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Graph graph = new SingleGraph("Dorogovtsev mendes");
 * Generator gen = new DorogovtsevMendesGenerator();
 * gen.addSink(graph);
 * gen.begin();
 * for(int i=0; i<100; i++) {
 * 		gen.nextEvents();
 * }
 * gen.end();
 * graph.display();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>References</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This kind of graph is described, among others, in the "Evolution of networks"
 * by Dorogovtsev and Mendes.
 * </p>

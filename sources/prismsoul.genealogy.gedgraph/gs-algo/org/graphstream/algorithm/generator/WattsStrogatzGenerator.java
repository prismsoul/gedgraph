/**
 * A generator following the small-world model of Watts and Strogatz.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator creates small-world graphs of arbitrary size.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This model
 * generates a ring of n nodes where each node is connected to its k nearest
 * neighbours in the ring (k/2 on each side, which means k must be even).
 * Then it process each node of the ring in order following the ring, and "rewiring"
 * each of their edges toward the not yet processed nodes with randomly chosen nodes
 * with a probability beta. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * You must provide values for n, k and beta at construction time. You must ensure
 * that k is event, that n >> k >> log(n) >> 1. Furthermore, beta being a probability
 * it must be between 0 and 1.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, the generator will produce a placement for nodes using the ``xyz``
 * attribute.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator will produce the ring of nodes once {@link #begin()} has been
 * called. Then calling {@link #nextEvents()} will rewire one node at a time
 * return true until each node is processed, in which case it returns false.
 * You must then call {@link #end()}. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Graph graph = new SingleGraph("This is a small world!");
 * Generator gen = new WattsStrogatzGenerator(20, 2, 0.5);
 * 
 * gen.addSink(graph);
 * gen.begin();
 * while(gen.nextEvents()) {}
 * gen.end();
 * 
 * graph.display(false); // Node position is provided.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Reference</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator is based on the Watts-Strogatz model.
 * </p>

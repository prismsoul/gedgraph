/**
 * Graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A graph generator is an object that can send graph events to create a
 * new graph from an internal description. Some generators will create a
 * static predefined graph, others will be able to continuously evolve
 * Indeed some generators define an end to the generation process, others
 * may continue endlessly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each generator, in addition of being a source of events, provide only
 * three methods:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>One to start the generation process {@link #begin()}.
 * 		For static generators this often generate a whole graph, for dynamic
 * 		generators this only initialise a base graph.</li>
 * 		<li>One to generate more dynamic events {@link #nextEvents()}.
 * 		This method will, as its name suggests, generate more dynamic
 * 		events making the graph evolve. You can call it (repeatedly) only
 * 		between a call to {@link #begin()} and to {@link #end()}. This
 * 		method returns a boolean that may indicate that no more events
 * 		can be generated.</li>
 * 		<li>One to end the generation process {@link #end()}. This method
 * 		must ALWAYS be called when finished with the generator.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

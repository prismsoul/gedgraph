/**
 * Generate a Petersen graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Petersen graph is an
 * undirected graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is a small graph that
 * serves as a useful example and counterexample for many problems in graph
 * theory. The Petersen graph is named for Julius Petersen, who in 1898
 * constructed it to be the smallest bridgeless cubic graph with no
 * three-edge-coloring. Although the graph is generally credited to Petersen, it
 * had in fact first appeared 12 years earlier, in a paper by A. B. Kempe
 * (1886). Donald Knuth states that the Petersen graph is "a remarkable
 * configuration that serves as a counterexample to many optimistic predictions
 * about what might be true for graphs in general."

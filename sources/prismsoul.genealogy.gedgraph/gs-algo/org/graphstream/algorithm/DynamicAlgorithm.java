package org.graphstream.algorithm;

/**
 * Defines algorithms able to handle dynamics of a graph. This is an extension
 * of the {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.Algorithm} so dynamic algorithms are
 * composed of an initialization step followed by several computation steps. A
 * last step, specific to dynamic algorithms, marks the termination of the
 * algorithm and has to be used to close the computation.
 * 
 * The following example computes the amount of apparitions of each node and the
 * average value of apparitions for nodes :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class ApparitionAlgorithm extends SinkAdapter implements
 * 		DynamicAlgorithm {
 * 
 * 	Graph theGraph;
 * 	HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; apparitions;
 * 	double avg;
 * 
 * 	public void init(Graph graph) {
 * 		theGraph = graph;
 * 		avg = 0;
 * 		graph.addSink(this);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void compute() {
 * 		avg = 0;
 * 
 * 		for (int a : apparitions.values())
 * 			avg += a;
 * 
 * 		avg /= apparitions.size();
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void terminate() {
 * 		graph.removeSink(this);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public double getAverageApparitions() {
 * 		return avg;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public int getApparitions(String nodeId) {
 * 		return apparitions.get(nodeId);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void nodeAdded(String sourceId, long timeId, String nodeId) {
 * 		int a = 0;
 * 
 * 		if (apparitions.containsKey(nodeId))
 * 			a = apparitions.get(nodeId);
 * 
 * 		apparitions.put(nodeId, a + 1);
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	public void stepBegins(String sourceId, long timeId, double step) {
 * 		compute();
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that in the example, the #terminate() method is used to remove the link
 * between graph and the algorithm. The computation here is done at every step
 * but can be done anywhere else, according to the algorithm requirements.
